# String Concatenate
<strong>Language: C</strong>

Concatenate user-inputted strings using malloc and pointer math.

Last week I learned I was using strcat() incorrectly, so I tried to roll my own. 

I wanted this to be my first project without including cs50.h, but after a bunch of googling on scanf(), sscanf(), and fgets(), it looks like I still need GetString() for now.
