# String Concatenate
<strong>Language: C</strong>

Concatenate user-inputted strings using calloc() and strcat().

First I rolled my own strcat() to make sure I properly understood it.

I wanted this to be my first project without cs50.h, but after googling on scanf(), sscanf(), and fgets(), Iâ€™ll stick with GetString() for now.

After it was working correctly, I went back to use strcpy() and strlen() and do it the best practices way, based on some advice from reddit.
